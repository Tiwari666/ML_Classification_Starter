# ML Classification Starter

This project walks you through building a complete binary classification model from scratch ‚Äî including model training, probability predictions, ROC curve plotting, and AUC evaluation.

Ideal for beginners looking to understand how classification performance is measured and visualized using real-world tools like `scikit-learn` and `matplotlib`.

---

##  Features

- Create synthetic classification data
- Train/test split using `train_test_split`
- Build a classification model using `LogisticRegression`
- Predict class probabilities with `predict_proba`
- Evaluate with:
  - ROC Curve (`roc_curve`)
  - AUC Score (`roc_auc_score`)
- Visualize results with `matplotlib`

---

##  What You'll Learn

- Difference between predicted class vs predicted probability
- How ROC and AUC work in binary classification
- How to interpret TPR, FPR, and thresholds
- Real plotting of model performance

---

##  Tech Stack

- Python 3.11.9
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas (if used)
